    ### Data Schema:
    - Each profile is a dictionary with the following fields:
      - `Experience`: A list of dictionaries, each representing a work experience with:
        - `title` (string): The job title.
        - `company` (string): The name of the company.
        - `duration_years` (float or string): The duration in years.
        - `description` (string): A description of the role.
      - `Education`: A list of dictionaries, each representing an academic qualification with:
        - `degree` (string): The name of the degree.
        - `institution` (string): The name of the institution.
        - `year` (int): The year of graduation.
      - `Skills`: A list of strings representing the candidate's skills.
      - `Summary`: A string summarizing the candidate's background.

    # Generate filtering code based on user query
    prompt = f"""
    You are an assistant that writes Python functions to filter profiles from a given dataset.
    The dataset is a JSON object where keys are candidate IDs and values are profiles.

    ### Rules for Writing Code:
    1. Always return a Python function named `filter_profiles`.
    2. The function should take one parameter: `profiles` (the dataset).
    3. Use proper Python syntax, including indentation.
    4. Ensure the function returns a dictionary of filtered profiles.
    5. Run the search against the 'Summary' field first (profile["Summary"]), and use the other fields like 'Experience', 'Skills', and 'Education' to refine the search if necessary.
    6. Follow the data schema provided below.

    {schema_description}

    ### Example Query:
    - Query: "Find candidates with experience in Agile methodologies."

    ### Example Output Code:
    ```python
    def filter_profiles(profiles):
        filtered_profiles = {{}}
        for candidate_id, profile in profiles.items():
            if <matching criteria found after analysing profile["Summary"]>:
                filtered_profiles[candidate_id] = profile
            elif any(<matching criteria> in exp.get("description", "") for exp in profile.get("Experience", [])):
                filtered_profiles[candidate_id] = profile
        return filtered_profiles
    ```

    Write Python code to filter profiles based on this query:
    Query: {query}
    Ensure the code is clean and follows Python standards.

    ### Instructions:
    1. Analyze the user query to understand exactly what the user wants to achieve, to determine if the proposed code will meet the requirements.
    1. Analyze the provided code for:
       - Logical errors or bugs.
       - Missing edge case handling.
       - Areas where the code might fail.
       - Analyse if the user is asking for one or N results, and verify that the code aligns with this requirement. If the user asks for "a" candidate or "any" candidate, or the best or worse candidate, the code should return just one candidate.
       - Verify if the function will return the number of users required by the user query.
       - Proper use of the data schema for filtering logic.
    2. Provide concise feedback on how to improve the code.

    1. Review the original code and the provided critique.
    2. Incorporate the critique to improve the code, addressing any logical errors, edge cases, or potential issues.
    3. Analyse if the user is asking for one or N results, and verify that the code aligns with this requirement. If the user asks for "a" candidate or "any" candidate, or the best or worse candidate, the code should return just one candidate.
    4 Verify if the function will return the number of users required by the user query. "a" candidate or "any" candidate, or the best or worse candidate, the code should return just one candidate.
    5. Check for case sensitivity in the search and fix accordingly.
    5. Ensure the refined code is ready to execute and follows Python standards and the function name is filter_profiles.
    6. Do not include comments, explanations, or markdowns in the outputâ€”only return executable Python code. Only runnable code.
    7. Strip any markdowns before returning the code. Make sure there are no triple backticks at the top or bottom of the code.
    8. The returned Python function MUST be named `filter_profiles`, no other name is allowed.
    9. Take a moment to reflect on the query, your resulting code, and the changes you made to improve it. If you find any issues, correct them before submitting the refined code.
